# Quote-Collection-Editor

Summary. If the user has an email subscription to the daily “quote of the day” from worldofquotes.com, the app will retrieve all quotes from the user’s inbox, delete the quotes from the user’s inbox, and add the quotes to a text file. The user can also add any quote manually.

Features. CLI. Quote and author binding. Clean and organized text formatting. Automatic or manual updating.

Technologies. Java 11, JavaMail API, POP3.

How to use. Edit `QuoteCollectionEditor.java` where appropriate. (i.e. Protocol, host, and port information. Email address and password can be either hardcoded or entered at the CL prompt.) Compile and run `Main.java`.

Note. It's not user friendly at the moment. Also...the quote server seems to have been permanently shut down. :(
